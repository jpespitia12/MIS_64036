## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Question 1
set.seed(2017) 
X=runif(100)*10 
Y=X*4+3.45 
Y=rnorm(100)*0.29*Y+Y 

#Question 1A
plot(Y~X,xlab = 'X', ylab = 'Y', col='red')
#Yes from the graph you can see that a linear model fits to explain Y and X

#Question 1B & 1C
model <- lm(Y~X)
summary(model)
model
#The equation that explains based on Y and X we can get from the code above. The y intercept is 4.465 and the coefficient x is 3.611. So the equation is as follows; Y = 4.465 + 3.611x
#Just as in the slides R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line
# So in that case, the accuracy is .6517 = 65.17%

cor(X,Y)^2
#just like how it explained in the slides if you calculate the correlation of X and Y and take that to the power 2,you get the same answer as R-squared. .6517


#Question 2A
head(mtcars)
plot(mtcars$hp~mtcars$wt, xlab = 'Weight', ylab = 'HP', col='red')
jamesModel <- lm(hp~wt,data = mtcars)
jamesModel
summary(jamesModel)
#James model R-squared is .4339. His model is 43.39% accurate

plot(mtcars$hp~mtcars$mpg, xlab='MPG', ylab = 'HP', col='red')
chrisModel <- lm(hp~mpg, data = mtcars)
chrisModel
summary(chrisModel)
#Chris model R-squared is .6024. His model is 60.24% accurate

#From comparing both James and Chris model we can conclude that Chris model is better, more accurate, than James.

#Question 2B
model2 <- lm(hp~cyl+mpg,data = mtcars)
summary(model2)

predictHP <- predict(model2, data.frame(cyl=4, mpg=22))
predictHP
#The estimated HP of a car with 4 calendar and mpg of 22 is 88HP


#Question 3A
# install.packages('mlbench') 
library(mlbench) 
data(BostonHousing) 

set.seed(2017)
model3 <- lm(medv~crim+zn+ptratio+chas, data = BostonHousing)
model3
summary(model3)
#I do not think it is accurate as the R-squared is .3599 which is 35.99% accurate

#Question 3B I
# Chas has two possibilities because it is a factor of 2 which is 0 and 1. 
# In the summary(model3) we can see that the coefficient of chas1 is 4.5893. The value that that represents in order to compare in $ is $4589. The one that is most expensive is chas1


#Question 3B II

#as you can see the coeffiecnt for the pupil teacher ratio is negative 1.49367. 
#If we multiply 15*(-1.49367) = -22.040 *1000 = -22,040
# If we multiply 18*(-1.49367) = -26.89 *1000 = -26,890

#since it is a decrease the most expensive one would be ptratio = 15 since it lost less money, hence more expensive than the other.The difference is $4850


#Question 3C
  #Just like in the slides explained, the p value is the probability that the hypothesis that, that particular coefficient is equal to 0 is true. So if this probability is small, we can reject that hypothesis, and we can make a conclusion that there are statistically significant relationships between the variables.
#As you can see from the summary of model 3 all the p values of the coefficients are small (close to zero) therefore they are all statistically important variables for house price.


#Question 3D
anova(model3)
# As expressed in the slides we use anova to show us the importance of our variables. 
    #1. crime
    #2. ptratio
    #3. zn
    #4. chas
